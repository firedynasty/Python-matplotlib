In this assignment, the goal was to analyze the data of treatment of different drugs to the different laboratory mice.  There were 249 mice experimented on, and 10 different treatments.

For all of the statistical analysis, I cut out the data of the timepoints that were not the last for each mice. Instead of analyzing the average mice tumor, I analyzed the final tumor size for each of the mice.  I thought this analysis would make the most sense.  

If you look at the full summary table, the mean of mice that received placebo had tumor sizes was 60.5.  There were a lot of tumor sizes around that size in the chart. 

The bar chart shows that there is an equal distribution of mice that received the different treatments. 

The pie chart shows that ratio between male and female mice were about equal that were used in the data set.  Data from one mouse was dropped from the study, "g989" because it had duplicate timepoints.  

The boxplots show that the means and medians for Capomulin and Ramicane are very similar that the drug is more effective than Ifubinol and Ceftamin.

There is a strong correlation that the drug Capomulin affects tumor size.
